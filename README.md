# wikiApp
This app was made to practice asynchronous functions in JavaScript

# Aspects

This repo contains two projects.  
## wikiApp
One is a wikiApp that will go and capture a screenshot of a website and then  
save the image to the server.
## redditApp
The second project is more extensive work with API's.

### Outline
I wish to be able with this app to go a nd pull the top level headings  
from a subreddit and store the specific data from that site in a JSON file  
and then go to the comments of each heading and in the same manner capture  
the specific data from the comments and save that to a JSON file.

#### Current Progress
So far I have the functionality created to do what I wish. I just need to  
flush it out a bit and then create a web page to display the data on.
