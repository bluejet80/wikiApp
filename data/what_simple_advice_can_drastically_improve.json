This might seem weird, but seeing yourself smile (even if it's a little) can really make you feel relieved.\n\nWorkout every day. A few pushups, situps, mountain climbers, bike biking; all of these can really strengthen your body and make you seem more confident once muscles start to show up.\n\nFind humour in life. Just like it the show \"The Office\", the reason it takes place in an office it's because it's boring. That's why it is a perfect place to find something humorous about it. This will eventually make you seem funnier and feel more confident talking in public. Stress and anxiety won't seem as hard as before, and thus it won't affect your aging and skin (studies have shown that a positive mood does improve physical and mental health by the hormones it provokes).\n\nAnd for my last one. Don't give a crap about what others say to let you down. Imagine this, they are speaking another language and you don't know if they are cursing, insulting, or offending you. Which means those words they are saying don't mean or make sense to you. That's how it should be. People make fun of others to feel better about themselves. So don't give their words meaning to you.\n\nHave a nice day to whoever read this. I wish you good luck in life. Byeee",
